# Project 1 - Sinclair (Simon) Says

## Description

This game is my own take on the classic game 'Simon Says'. The CPU will generate a pattern of lights and sound and the user must repeat the pattern correctly to score.

The UI is based on a drum machine used for music production. Each pad will play a specified sound (or group of sounds) like a drum machine.

Game over is when the user fails 3 times or the score limit is broken.
